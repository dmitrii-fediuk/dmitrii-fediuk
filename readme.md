ðŸ”¸ My primary Magento project is [`mage2pro/core`](https://github.com/mage2pro/core): a unique middleware that bridges the gap between the out-of-box Magento / Adobe Commerce software and the needs of real-world information systems.       
It is the main result of my work with Magento / Adobe Commerce for 15 years, since 2010.

ðŸ”¸ Internet  
I rarely use the regular Internet.  
Instead, I create a [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for each website that I plan to visit â‰¥ 3 times a year and apply it via [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io).  
The userscript hides all the visual garbage from the website's interface: header, footer, sidebars, pop-ups, sticky elements, chat widgets, cookie consent banners, survey forms, and so on.  
To further eliminate distractions, I remove any empty space (such as the blank margins on fixed-width pages) and enforce 2 clean, large, and comfortable fonts to every website: one for ordinary text, and another for software code.  
When I read your messages on Upwork, only their text appears on the screen.  
This allows me to focus deeply on the meaning of your messages, on every word and comma you have written.  
I delve into what you write and think deeply about my answers.  
This is one of the reasons why I almost always reply to your messages slowly: I think deeply.  
Also, to achieve the highest quality, I usually dedicate the entire day to a single task, not jumping between tasks.   
For these 2 reasons, I usually respond to your messages â‰¤ once a day.  
The only exception is the task I am working on that day: since I have been deeply immersed in it since the morning, I can respond to messages about that task more frequently.

🔸 GitHub: **47K+** public commits, [**248**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro) repos  
🔸 **26** years of experience  
🔸 Certified **[IQ 145](https://df.tips/t/2644)**  
🔸 Magento (Adobe Commerce): top **10** worldwide, [**129**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-module-ready) open source modules 
🔸 [𝟐𝟒 certifications](https://www.credly.com/users/dmitrii-fediuk) validated by Credly
🔸 Advanced university degree in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**, specializing in **AI**  
🔸 **AI** / **Tools**  
I avoid natural language queries and use a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) to first build a detailed domain [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).    
It makes the AI's reasoning ferociously powerful: it understands the essence of the task and discards unproductive hypotheses faster, allocating computational resources to significant ones.  
🔸 **AI** / **My current models** (**July 2025**)  
I always use the most powerful publicly available AIs, regardless of their price.  
As of today, these are:
1) **Gemini 2.5 Pro** 𝐆𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐢 𝟐.𝟓 𝐏𝐫𝐨 
2) **OpenAI**'s **o3-pro**

Since May 2025, I believe #1 surpasses #2 in both Reasoning and Deep Research.   
I still use #2 for a second opinion.   
I also have subscriptions to **Claud 4 Opus** and **Grok 4 Heavy**, but find them significantly inferior to the top two.  
🔸 **AI** / **Deep Research**  
It increased the productivity of knowledge gathering by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to searching for information via Google and then analyzing the articles independently.   
🔸 **AI** / **Reasoning**  
With an IQ of 145, I have always been good at reasoning on my own.  
In my areas of expertise (e.g., programming), I find the quality of AI reasoning to be mediocre, even after 15-30 minutes of deliberation.  
However, AI reasoning has increased my productivity:
1) It validates my own reasoning against cognitive biases and omissions.
2) It is very strong in interdisciplinary research, because it integrates multiple domains of knowledge. 
 
🔸 **AI** / **Translation**  
I can converse with you in your native language at the highest literary level because I have built my own multi-level translation pipeline that considers the subject domain, project context, and preceding dialogue.  
🔸 **My lifestyle**  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 I work only after a full night's sleep and a high-intensity physical workout with multiple cold-water immersions to ensure maximum mental clarity.   
    I repeat the workout and cold-water immersions every **3**-**4** hours.  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 I take **20+** supplements daily to boost my mental capacity and general health ([α-lipoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid), [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) + [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine) ([GlyNAC](https://www.google.com/search?q=GlyNAC+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US)), [Acetyl-L-carnitine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine), [DMAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylethanolamine), [Astragalus mongholicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astragalus_mongholicus) + [TA-65](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloastragenol), [Ubiquinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquinol), [Hericium erinaceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hericium_erinaceus), [Cordyceps militaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps_militaris), [Lingzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)), [Rhodiola rosea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodiola_rosea), [Bacopa monnieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacopa_monnieri), [Berberine](https://www.google.com/search?q=Berberine+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Ginkgo biloba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba), [Centella asiatica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centella_asiatica), [Panax ginseng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panax_ginseng), [Matcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha), [Chaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inonotus_obliquus) + [Betula pendula bark](https://www.google.com/search?q=Betulin+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Omega-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) + [Cod liver oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_liver_oil), [Salvia officinalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_officinalis), [Spermidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermidine), [Shiitake](https://www.google.com/search?q=Shiitake+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Shilajit](https://www.google.com/search?q=Shilajit+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US)).  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 I eat only what fuels my maximum performance: nuts, greens, fish oil, vegetables, berries, seeds, dairy products (and supplements mentioned above).   
⠀⠀⠀⠀I do not eat sugar-added products, meat, flour, fried food, fast food, or other junk food.  
🔸 **My workspace**  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 A perfect workstation with 3 big monitors  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 All pop-ups, sound alerts, notifications in my UI are entirely disabled  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 A top-tier, ergonomic chair with customized back- and head-support cushions made of the finest goose down  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 Total acoustic isolation  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 My phone is always silent  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 Not distracted by anyone  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 Perfectly balanced air conditioning and ventilation  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 Overlooking the Sea of Marmara, breathing in clean sea air  
🔸 My primary Magento project is [`mage2pro/core`](https://github.com/mage2pro/core): a unique middleware that bridges the gap between the out-of-box Magento / Adobe Commerce software and the needs of real-world information systems.       
It is the main result of my work with Magento / Adobe Commerce for 15 years, since 2010.  
🔸 **My Magento modules**:  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 [**129 open source**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-module-ready)  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 [**61 reusable**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-module-reusable)  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 [**68 bespoke**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-module-bespoke)  
⠀⠀⠀⠀🔅 [**26 payment**](https://github.com/topics/mage2pro-payment)

🔸 **Internet**  
I rarely use the regular Internet.  
Instead, I create a [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for each website that I plan to visit ≥ 3 times a year and apply it via [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io).  
The userscript hides all the visual garbage from the website's interface: header, footer, sidebars, pop-ups, sticky elements, chat widgets, cookie consent banners, survey forms, and so on.  
To further eliminate distractions, I remove any empty space (such as the blank margins on fixed-width pages) and enforce 2 clean, large, and comfortable fonts to every website: one for ordinary text, and another for software code.  
When I read your messages on Upwork, only their text appears on the screen.  
This allows me to focus deeply on the meaning of your messages, on every word and comma you have written.  
I delve into what you write and think deeply about my answers.  
This is one of the reasons why I almost always reply to your messages slowly: I think deeply.  
Also, to achieve the highest quality, I usually dedicate the entire day to a single task, not jumping between tasks.   
For these 2 reasons, I usually respond to your messages ≤ once a day.  
The only exception is the task I am working on that day: since I have been deeply immersed in it since the morning, I can respond to messages about that task more frequently.

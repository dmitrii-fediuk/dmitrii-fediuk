🔸 Master of Science in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**, specializing in **AI**  
🔸 **AI** / **My methodology**   
🔅 I avoid natural language queries to LLMs.   
Instead, I have developed my own [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) to construct [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) and execute subsequent ontology-based queries to LLMs.  
This language is based on the principles of mathematical logic and draws upon the extensive history of knowledge representation languages: [Description Logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic), [OWL (Web Ontology Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language), [RDFS (RDF Schema)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_Schema), [SKOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System), [Common Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Logic), [Conceptual Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_graph), [OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBO_Foundry), [CycL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CycL), [KL-ONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KL-ONE), [KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Interchange_Format), [F-Logic (Frame Logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-logic).  
🔅 Thus, my first step in solving any AI task is constructing an ontology (a domain model) in my formal language.  
This rigorous process typically requires hours (and sometimes days).     
🔅 Once the ontology is constructed, I query the LLM using my formal language, attaching both the language specification and the ontology.  
This methodology makes the AI's reasoning ferociously powerful: it accurately captures the essence of the task and discards unproductive hypotheses faster, directing the reasoning process towards the most promising ones.  
I always use the most powerful publicly available AIs, regardless of their price; consequently, their context windows and computational resources are sufficient to process such complex queries.  
🔸 **AI** / **My current models** (**September 2025**)  
As of today, the most powerful publicly available AI is **Gemini 2.5** **[Deep Think](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-2-5-Deep-Think-Model-Card.pdf)**.  
I use **4** parallel **Gemini AI** **[Ultra](https://gemini.google/subscriptions#plans)** accounts (totaling **$1000/mo**).   
Thus, I have access to **40 queries** to **Deep Think** per day, which makes it my primary tool.  
I also maintain subscriptions to the most expensive AIs from the other 3 major providers, which I use for cross-validation: **OpenAI o5 Pro** (**$240/mo**), **Claude 4.1 Opus** (**$240/mo**), **SuperGrok 4 Heavy** (**$360/mo**).  
🔸 **Language**    
I can communicate with you in your native language at a native professional level because I have developed my own multi-stage AI-based translation pipeline that integrates the subject domain, project context, and preceding dialogue.   
🔸 **Lifestyle**  
🔅 I sleep 9-10 hours daily, without exceptions.
Deep and prolonged sleep is the foundation for maintaining my cognitive function, health, and daytime performance.  
🔅 I dedicate 2 hours to physical training daily, without exceptions: 1 hour before work and 1 hour after work.  
Training before work promotes my high performance throughout the day.    
Training after work promotes my deep and healthy sleep.
🔅 In addition to each training, I always take ice baths. 
🔅 I take **20+** daily to boost my cognitive function and general healt ([α-lipoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid), [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) + [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine) ([GlyNAC](https://www.google.com/search?q=GlyNAC+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US)), [Acetyl-L-carnitine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine), [DMAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylethanolamine), [Astragalus mongholicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astragalus_mongholicus) + [TA-65](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloastragenol), [Ubiquinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquinol), [Hericium erinaceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hericium_erinaceus), [Cordyceps militaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps_militaris), [Lingzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)), [Rhodiola rosea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodiola_rosea), [Bacopa monnieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacopa_monnieri), [Berberine](https://www.google.com/search?q=Berberine+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Ginkgo biloba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba), [Centella asiatica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centella_asiatica), [Panax ginseng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panax_ginseng), [Matcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha), [Chaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inonotus_obliquus) + [Betula pendula bark](https://www.google.com/search?q=Betulin+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Omega-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) + [Cod liver oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_liver_oil), [Salvia officinalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_officinalis), [Spermidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermidine), [Shiitake](https://www.google.com/search?q=Shiitake+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US), [Shilajit](https://www.google.com/search?q=Shilajit+site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&pws=0&gl=US)).  
🔅 I eat only what fuels my maximum performance: nuts, greens, fish oil, vegetables, berries, seeds, dairy products.   
I do not eat products with added sugar, meat, flour-based products, fried foods, fast food, or other junk food.  
I intentionally moved to Türkiye for year-round access to supremely fresh, high-quality produce.   
🔸 **Workspace**    
🔅 High-end workstation with 3 large monitors  
🔅 Distraction-free environment:  
    - Complete soundproofing
    - All notifications (pop-ups, sound alerts) on my workstation are disabled
	- My phone is always silent
🔅 Top-tier and custom-fitted ergonomic chair  
🔅 Perfectly balanced air conditioning and ventilation  
🔅 Panoramic view of the Sea of Marmara and excellent sea air quality   
🔸 My primary Magento project is [`mage2pro/core`](https://github.com/mage2pro/core): a unique middleware that bridges the gap between the out-of-box Magento / Adobe Commerce software and the needs of real-world information systems.       
It is the main result of my work with Magento / Adobe Commerce for 15 years, since 2010.
